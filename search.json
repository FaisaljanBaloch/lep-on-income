    "text": "This income distribution plot demonstrates clear education and gender premiums, with graduate degree holders earning substantially more than those with less education and males consistently out-earning females across all groups. Limited English Proficiency appears to have a modest negative impact on income, particularly at higher education levels, while significant income inequality is evident through extensive high-income outliers reaching $750,000+ across all subgroups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis education distribution plot reveals a stark educational divide between LEP groups, with Limited English Proficiency individuals heavily concentrated in lower education levels (nearly 50% have less than high school education) while English proficient individuals are more evenly distributed across education levels and comprise the majority of those with graduate degrees (around 40%)."

    "text": "Language proficiency is one of the key requirements in almost every job posting, and being proficient in a language can open new doors for an individual. Using a sample of data drawn from the American Community Surveys (U.S. Census) of 2021-2023, I seek to examine the effect of Limited English proficiency on a person’s income in the USA. I used R to look at the insights into how Limited English Proficiency (LEP) effects a person’s wage when controling education level and gender. I modeled a person’s income, as a linear function of her English profiency, education level, and gender. Across all education levels, males earn 20–50% more than females, with the largest gender and language-based income gaps appearing at the graduate level where English Proficient males earn over $70,000, nearly 50% more than their female counterparts."
