This income distribution plot demonstrates clear education and gender premiums, with graduate degree holders earning substantially more than those with less education and males consistently out-earning females across all groups. Limited English Proficiency appears to have a modest negative impact on income, particularly at higher education levels, while significant income inequality is evident through extensive high-income outliers reaching $750,000+ across all subgroups.

This education distribution plot reveals a stark educational divide between LEP groups, with Limited English Proficiency individuals heavily concentrated in lower education levels (nearly 50% have less than high school education) while English proficient individuals are more evenly distributed across education levels and comprise the majority of those with graduate degrees (around 40%).
